Steps to Perform the Lab
1. Simulating Bluetooth Scanning
You can simulate Bluetooth scanning using software tools available on your computer:

Install BlueHydra:

BlueHydra can be installed on a Linux machine or a virtual machine (VM). Follow the instructions on the BlueHydra GitHub page.

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install bluez
git clone https://github.com/pwnieexpress/blue_hydra.git
cd blue_hydra
sudo gem install bundler
bundle install
sudo ./blue_hydra
Simulate Bluetooth Devices:

Use software like Bluetooth simulator apps or Bluetooth emulation tools to simulate Bluetooth devices on your VM.
2. Simulating Bluejacking and Bluesnarfing

Step-by-Step Process
Setup Python Environment

Install necessary libraries: pybluez for Bluetooth scanning and scapy for networking.
Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
Bluetooth Scanning

Discover Bluetooth devices in the vicinity.
Retrieve information about these devices, such as their names and addresses.
Simulate Vulnerability Exploits

Bluejacking: Send unsolicited messages to nearby Bluetooth devices.
Bluesnarfing: Simulate access to unauthorized information on Bluetooth devices.
Step 1: Setup Python Environment
First, ensure you have Python installed, then set up a virtual environment and install the required libraries.

bash
Copy code
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv bluetooth_env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
bluetooth_env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source bluetooth_env/bin/activate

# Install necessary libraries
pip install pybluez scapy
Step 2: Bluetooth Scanning
Here's how to discover Bluetooth devices using pybluez:

python
Copy code
import bluetooth

def discover_devices():
    print("Searching for Bluetooth devices...")
    nearby_devices = bluetooth.discover_devices(lookup_names=True)
    
    if not nearby_devices:
        print("No devices found.")
        return []
    
    print(f"Found {len(nearby_devices)} devices.")
    for addr, name in nearby_devices:
        print(f"  Address: {addr} - Name: {name}")
    
    return nearby_devices

if __name__ == "__main__":
    devices = discover_devices()
Step 3: Simulate Bluejacking and Bluesnarfing
Simulate Bluejacking
Bluejacking involves sending unsolicited messages to a Bluetooth device. Since we can't send actual messages without physical devices, we'll simulate the process.

python
Copy code
def simulate_bluejacking(devices):
    if not devices:
        print("No devices to bluejack.")
        return

    for addr, name in devices:
        print(f"Simulating Bluejacking to {name} at {addr}...")
        # In a real scenario, you would send a message here.
        # e.g., using OBEX protocol to send a business card (vCard)
        # obex.send_vcard(addr, "John Doe", "john@example.com")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    devices = discover_devices()
    simulate_bluejacking(devices)
Simulate Bluesnarfing
Bluesnarfing involves accessing unauthorized data from a Bluetooth device. This simulation will show what steps might be taken, but actual data access can't be performed without real devices and would be illegal without permission.

python
Copy code
def simulate_bluesnarfing(devices):
    if not devices:
        print("No devices to bluesnarf.")
        return

    for addr, name in devices:
        print(f"Simulating Bluesnarfing {name} at {addr}...")
        # In a real scenario, you would attempt to access data here.
        # This could involve connecting to known services and attempting to read files or contacts.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    devices = discover_devices()
    simulate_bluesnarfing(devices)
Conclusion
The above code snippets provide a basic framework for simulating Bluetooth scanning and the concept of Bluejacking and Bluesnarfing. Remember, these simulations are educational and ethical; real-world Bluetooth exploitation should only be done in controlled, legal environments with explicit permission.
